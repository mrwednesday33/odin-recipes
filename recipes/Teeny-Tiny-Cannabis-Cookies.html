    <h2 class="description">Description</h2>
    <p>Tiny food tastes better. Since these cannabis cookies are so small, a microdose means everyone can customize their experience without getting too high. (Also since they’re so small, they bake up quickly, so keep a close eye on the oven and err on the side of underbaking since they crisp up as they cool.)
        <br>
        Each cookie sandwich doses at 3 milligrams of THC, which means each cookie doses at 1½ milligrams of THC. But if you’re making the cookies on their own and are new to edibles, start with one or two cookie sandwiches (that’s two or four cookies), then wait a couple hours to feel the effects.</p>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <div class="container">
    <ol>
        <li>Make the cannabutter</li>
        <p><i><b>Cannabis Oatmeal Cookies & Cream Cheese Frosting</b></i></p>
        <li>Heat the oven to 350°F(177℃).</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, sift or whisk the flour with the baking soda, cinnamon, and salt.</li>
        <li>Melt the cannabutter on the stove (or simply use after making, before it's had a chance to cool). In a large bowl, whisk the melted butter with the sugar and molasses. Stir in the egg and 1 teaspoon of vanilla until combined.</li>
        <li>Gently stir the flour mixture into the butter mixture, until just a few specks of flour remain. Stir in the oats and refrigerate the dough until firm enough to roll into balls, about 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Using a scale, weigh out 5-gram portions (about ½ teaspoon) and roll into balls. Place on a parchment- or silicone-lined cookie sheet 1½ inches apart. Bake for 5 to 7 minutes, until the tops look mostly dry and matte (they will crisp as they cool, so lean toward underbaking if you’re unsure). As soon as the cookies come out of the oven, transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
        <li>In a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat the cream cheese, maple syrup, lemon juice, remaining 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla, and a pinch of salt until fluffy and smooth. Add half the cream and beat again until incorporating, scraping down the bowl as needed. Add the rest of the cream and beat until fluffy and spreadable, like frosting.</li>
        <li>Sandwich the cookies with the cream cheese frosting. If you're not serving them all at once, you can also keep the cookies and frosting separate. In an airtight container, the cookies will keep at room temperature for several days or in the freezer for several weeks. In an airtight container, the frosting will keep in the fridge for a few days.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="quote">If you're considering enjoying this recipe, please consult and follow the legal restrictions for controlled substances in your state. Because there are so many variables with homemade edibles, go slowly. You may want to start with half a serving and determine your tolerance and ideal dose from there. And always wait a couple hours to feel the effects. —<i>Mr.Wednesday</i></p>
